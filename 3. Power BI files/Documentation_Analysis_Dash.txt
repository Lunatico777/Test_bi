- As a first step in understanding the business, 4 dimensions are identified, which are Country, Year, NextUser, and Project.

- To obtain the classification of the Innovation score, the table containing this parameter is examined, 
identifying duplicates of the same records with a different score (it is necessary to ask the expert about the reason for this duplication). 
However, for practical purposes of the exercise, for rows that have different scores associated with the same project_id, the average of these scores is taken to normalize values. 
Following this, we can build the project dimension and calculate the score grouped by id_YEAR, as the same project can have a different score for each year.

- ID_YEAR is then identified as the primary key (PK). With this, we can cross-reference the fact table with the countries and next_users tables and bring in that information for potential business inquiries.
